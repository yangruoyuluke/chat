## Overview

This project is a chat interface to interact with various text generation models supported by [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com). It allows users to set different LLM parameters, toggle response streaming, handle streaming/non-streaming responses, parse markdown in responses, and includes a dark mode.

[Read the blog post on how I created this LLM playground](https://rajeev.dev/create-cloudflare-workers-ai-llm-playground-using-nuxthub-and-nuxtui).

## Features

* Select the text generation model to interact with
* Set different LLM parameters (temperature, max tokens, system prompt, top_p, top_k, etc.)
* Toggle LLM response streaming on/off
* Handle streaming and non-streaming LLM responses on both server and client sides
* Parse and display markdown in LLM responses
* Auto-scroll chat container as responses are streamed
* Dark mode support

## Technologies Used

* [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com): Vue.js framework for the application foundation
* [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com): Module for creating a sleek and responsive interface
* [Nuxt MDC](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc): For parsing and displaying chat messages
* [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com): Deployment and administration platform for Nuxt, powered by Cloudflare

## Prerequisites

* [Cloudflare Account](https://cloudflare.com): Required for using Workers AI models and deploying the project on Cloudflare Pages
* [NuxtHub Account](https://hub.nuxt.com): For managing NuxtHub apps and using AI in development

> You can deploy and manage this application with a free Cloudflare and free NuxtHub account.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
pnpm i
```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the following environment variables (for NuxtHub project key see point 3):

```bash
# Directly set your nuxthub project key without running npx nuxthub link
NUXT_HUB_PROJECT_KEY=your_nuxthub_project_key
# how to find account id for workers/pages https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/#find-account-id-workers-and-pages
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
# How to create PAI token https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token
```

3. If you didn't set your NuxtHub project key in point 2 above, link your NuxtHub project to use AI models in development (it will ask you to create one if you don't have any)

```bash
npx nuxthub link
```

4. Start the application in development mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
